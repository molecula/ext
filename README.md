# Molecula extension API (v0, already deprecated)

This is an experimental API for extensions/plugins for Molecula. There
are known flaws in this API. Please don't develop things using this
version of the API. It's a placeholder to allow us to do some experiments
with the interactions between extensions and the main code.
